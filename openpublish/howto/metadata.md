##Metadata
There are two types of metadata:

- Metadata that describes the content and is created by content author
- Metadata that describes how the content will be published and rendered. These metadata are often injected during publishing, or added by content owner/site manager.

### Document Metadata
Below are the metadata content author should provide in the header of the markdown file. Publishing system will store these metadata in the database for future query.

| Metadata Name | Input Channel | Metadata Value | Required |
| ------------- | ------------- | -------------- | -------- |
| ms.ContentId | Author provided or generated by publishing system if missing in content body | GUID | Yes|
| ms.Version | Author provides | Text string | No|
| ms.Locale | Author provides | Text string | Yes|
| Title | Author provides | Text string | No|
| Description | Author provides | Text string | No|
| Robots | Define if a topic should be crawled by search engine Web crawler | Default - Index-follow | No|
| ms.Canonical | Author indicates for topics rendered with multiple site URL | URL string | No|
| ms.ShortId | Author provides(only needed for legacy content) | Text string | No|
| Additional metadata(need pre-fix "Custom-" to avoid namespace collision) | Author provides, it will be directly translated into HTML metadata | Text string | No|

#### Metadata Override
A metadata value can be override if it is defined in multiple locations with the following order
1. Metadata value defined in the markdown file has the highest priority and will override the value defined in metadata files
2. metadata value defined in the metadata files in the child folder will override the value of the same metadata defined in the parent folder.

### Publishing Metadata
Below are the metadata that publishing system will generate and store in publishing database 

During publishing, the following metadata will be generated by the publishing system and stored in a database for query by rendering component or content owner. 

-  Publishing account info 
- VSO Repo info 
- Rendering site and UX theme info 
- Publishing time (start, completed, last updated etc.) 
- Errors 

### Authoring Metadata
In markdown file (both content file and metadata file), metadata should be defined as the name/value pair. In content markdown file,  metadata should be starting at the very top of the file.
