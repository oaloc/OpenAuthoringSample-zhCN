### Get the tools

#### Get Git

* Visual Studio with Git: 

  - 2013 is a stable choice, and it works with MarkdownMode (see below).

  - 2015 RC has enhancements in areas such as branch management. And it is goodness to dogfood. It does not work with MarkdownMode. 

  - 2012 is not recommended.

* Your favorite Git client.

#### Get a Markdown editor

Some of us like these tools:

 * [MarkdownMode](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/STBCSI/e/CE/Azure%20Documents/MarkdownMode.vsix) Visual Studio 2013 plug-in

 * [MarkdownPad](http://www.markdownpad.com/)

 * Notepad, VI, or some some other austere text editor of your choice

**Tip:** You can also edit your Markdown directly in your web browser. Just navigate to the file in your repo and edit it.
